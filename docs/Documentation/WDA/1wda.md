# Getting Started with Well-Defined Architecture

A well-defined architecture is a clear and documented framework that outlines the components and their interactions in a system.

To obtain a WDA (Well-Defined Architecture) for your application, you will need to provide detailed information about the application, entities, and deployment. This documentation is essential for ensuring that your architecture is properly designed and meets all necessary requirements.

Firstly, you will need to provide information about your application, including its purpose, scope, and goals. This information will help us understand the context in which your WDA will be used and ensure that it is aligned with your business objectives.

Next, you will need to provide information about the entities that will be used in your WDA, including their relationships, attributes, and interactions. This information will help us create a data model that accurately reflects your application's requirements and enables seamless integration with other systems.

Finally, you will need to provide information about the deployment environment, including the hardware, software, and network infrastructure that will be used to host your WDA. This information will help us ensure that your architecture is properly configured and optimized for performance, security, and scalability.

By providing us with these details, we can work together to design a WDA that meets your specific needs and enables you to achieve your business goals with ease.

To provide you with a better understanding, we have given more detailed information and  the possible values of the three parameters, namely application, entities, and deployment. By understanding the range of possible values for each of these parameters, we can ensure that our response is accurate and comprehensive.
